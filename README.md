## Objective

Create a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.

1. Add Books:
- Users should be able to add new books to the library.
- Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and publication year.

2. Borrow Books:
- Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
- The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be borrowed.
- If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.

3. Return Books:
- Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
- The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.

4. View Available Books:
- Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

## Requirements

- Python should be Installed on the System

## How to Run

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ybarvaliya/TDD-Library-Management-System.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd TDD-Library-Management-System
   ```

4. write command for the installations of Library

    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest -cov
    ```

5. write below command to run Tests 

    ```bash
    pytest test_library.py -v
    ```

## Test Cases

### Add User

- Adding a User with all valid details should be successful
- Adding a User with missing userId should raise an error
- Adding a User with missing name should raise an error
- Adding a User with duplicate userId should raise an error

### Add Book

- Adding a Book with all valid details should be successful
- Adding a Book with missing ISBN should raise an error
- Adding a Book with missing title should raise an error
- Adding a Book with missing author should raise an error
- Adding a Book with missing publication should raise an error
- Adding a Book with duplicate ISBN should raise an error

### Borrow Book

- Borrowing a Book with valid ISBN and userId should be successful
- Borrowing a Book with missing userId should raise an error
- Borrowing a Book with missing ISBN should raise an error
- Borrowing a Book that is not available should raise an error
- Borrowing a non-existent Book should raise an error
- Borrowing a Book with not-existent userId (user) should raise an error

### Return Book

- Returning a Book with valid ISBN and userId should be successful
- Returning a Book with missing userId should raise an error
- Returning a Book with missing ISBN should raise an error
- Returning a Book that is not available should raise an error
- Returning a non-existent Book should raise an error
- Returning a Book with not-existent userId (user) should raise an error

### View Books

### Remove Book

- Removing a book with valid ISBN should be successful
- Removing a book without ISBN should raise an error
- Removing a book with invalid ISBN should raise an error

### Remove User

- Removing a user with valid userId should be successful
- Removing a user without userId should raise an error
- Removing a user with userId ISBN should raise an error

## Reports

### Test Case Report

- To check yourself write commands
    
    ```bash
    pytest test_library.py -v
    ```
