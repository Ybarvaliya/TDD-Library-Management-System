## Objective

Create a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.

1. Add Books:
- Users should be able to add new books to the library.
- Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and publication year.

2. Borrow Books:
- Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
- The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be borrowed.
- If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.

3. Return Books:
- Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
- The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.

4. View Available Books:
- Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

## Requirements

- Python should be Installed on the System

## How to Run

1. fork / download the repo on your system
2. naviagate to the folder in shell / cmd
3. write command into shell / cmd "pip install pytest pytest -cov" (To install pytest - library in python for unit testing)
4. write command into shell / cmd "pytest test_library.py -v" (It will start running tests)
